# NOTE:
This script adds .ass subtitles to .mkv videos for anime only.

# USAGE
1. Run the code using Python.
2. Enter the folder directory (copy it using Windows Explorer).
3. The code will run through all of your videos, add the matching subtitle's name to them, 
and export the files to a newly created folder ("Exports") in the same directory.

# Installation
1. Git clone https://github.com/Kirito72-hub/mergeSubMkvAss.git
2. Download [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
3. You can use this script to rename the .ass files to match the videos or do it manually 
    (clone https://github.com/Kirito72-hub/matchEpisodeName.git).
4. Important Note: The subtitle name must be the same as the video name, the only difference is the extensions.
